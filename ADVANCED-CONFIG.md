# Advanced Configuration

For getting started and the interactive wizard overview, see [README.md](README.md#-configuration).

## Configuration Commands

| Action      | Example                                              |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| View all configs | `backlog config list` |
| Get specific config | `backlog config get defaultEditor` |
| Set config value | `backlog config set defaultEditor "code --wait"` |
| Enable auto-commit | `backlog config set autoCommit true` |
| Bypass git hooks | `backlog config set bypassGitHooks true` |
| Enable cross-branch check | `backlog config set checkActiveBranches true` |
| Set active branch days | `backlog config set activeBranchDays 30` |
| Set default assignees | `backlog config set defaultAssignee "@alice,@bob"` |
| Rank tasks by RICE | `backlog config set prioritization rice` |

Running `backlog config` with no arguments launches the interactive advanced wizard, including guided Definition of Done defaults editing (add/remove/reorder/clear).

## Detailed Notes

> Editor setup guide: See [Configuring VIM and Neovim as Default Editor](backlog/docs/doc-002%20-%20Configuring-VIM-and-Neovim-as-Default-Editor.md) for configuration tips and troubleshooting interactive editors.

> **Note**: Set `remoteOperations: false` to work offline. This disables git fetch operations and loads tasks from local branches only, useful when working without network connectivity.

> **Git Control**: By default, `autoCommit` is set to `false`, giving you full control over your git history. Task operations will modify files but won't automatically commit changes. Set `autoCommit: true` if you prefer automatic commits for each task operation.

> **Git Hooks**: If you have pre-commit hooks (like conventional commits or linters) that interfere with backlog.md's automated commits, set `bypassGitHooks: true` to skip them using the `--no-verify` flag.

> **Performance**: Cross-branch checking ensures accurate task tracking across all active branches but may impact performance on large repositories. You can disable it by setting `checkActiveBranches: false` for maximum speed, or adjust `activeBranchDays` to control how far back to look for branch activity (lower values = better performance).

> **Status Change Callbacks**: Set `onStatusChange` to run a shell command whenever a task's status changes. Available variables: `$TASK_ID`, `$OLD_STATUS`, `$NEW_STATUS`, `$TASK_TITLE`. Per-task override via `onStatusChange` in task frontmatter. Example: `'if [ "$NEW_STATUS" = "In Progress" ]; then claude "Task $TASK_ID ($TASK_TITLE) has been assigned to you. Please implement it." & fi'`

> **Default Assignee**: `defaultAssignee` is a list, so `backlog config set defaultAssignee "@alice,@bob"` stores both names. Every create surface (CLI `task create` and `draft create`, the creation wizard, TUI, Web, MCP) applies it when no assignee is supplied. An explicit assignee replaces the default entirely instead of merging with it, and setting the value to an empty string clears the default so new tasks start unassigned. To keep a single task unassigned while the default stays configured, pass an explicit empty assignee: `backlog task create "Title" -a ""`. The same value clears existing assignees on edit: `backlog task edit BACK-1 -a ""` (MCP `task_create`/`task_edit` use an empty `assignee` array). When editing `config.yml` by hand, quote the names (`default_assignee: ["@alice"]`) because `@` starts a reserved YAML character; a value YAML cannot read is ignored rather than guessed at.

> **Priority Values**: Set `priorities` to an ordered list of labels such as `["Very High", "High", "Medium", "Low", "Very Low"]`. The first value sorts highest. CLI, MCP, and Web inputs accept configured values case-insensitively and store normalized lowercase values in task frontmatter.

> **RICE Prioritization**: `backlog config set prioritization rice` replaces priority with RICE scoring on every surface. Each task stores up to four inputs under a `rice:` map in its frontmatter: `reach` (a number of 0 or more, such as people or events per quarter), `impact` (3 massive, 2 high, 1 medium, 0.5 low, 0.25 minimal), `confidence` (100, 80 or 50 percent) and `effort` (a number greater than 0, such as person-months). The score is `reach × impact × confidence% ÷ effort`; it is computed when read and never stored, and a task has no score until all four inputs are set. Set inputs with `backlog task create "Title" --reach 500 --impact 2 --confidence 80 --effort 3`, change one with `backlog task edit <id> --effort 2`, and clear one with an empty value (`--reach ""`). Everything that orders by priority orders by score instead, highest first with unscored tasks last: `task list`, `task list --sort priority`, and the board's sort-by-priority action. In RICE mode `--priority` and priority filters fail with an explanation; in the default `priority` mode the RICE flags do. Switching modes never rewrites task files, so priorities or RICE inputs already recorded stay in place and reappear if you switch back. `--json` output reports `priority: null` and a `rice` object with the inputs and `score` in RICE mode, and `rice: null` in priority mode.

> **Project Values**: `projects` tags each task with one project in a monorepo-style backlog. It has no default, so the field stays inert until you set it — until then no surface offers it, and `--project` fails with a message naming the config file. Set it by editing the project config file directly (like `statuses`, `labels`, `types`, and `priorities`, it cannot be changed with `backlog config set`):
>
> ```yaml
> projects: ["web", "api", "mobile"]
> ```
>
> Once configured, CLI, MCP, and Web inputs accept the values case-insensitively and store the configured spelling in task frontmatter. Filter with `backlog task list --project web`, `backlog search --project web`, or repeat/comma-separate values for OR semantics. Clear a task's project with `backlog task edit <id> --project ""`. Read current values with `backlog config get projects`.

> **Date/Time Support**: Backlog.md now supports datetime precision for all dates. New items automatically include time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm format in UTC), while existing date-only entries remain unchanged for backward compatibility. Use the migration script `bun src/scripts/migrate-dates.ts` to optionally add time to existing items.

> **Date Display Format**: `dateFormat` only changes how dates are *displayed* in the web UI and TUI; markdown files always store dates in the canonical `yyyy-mm-dd [hh:mm]` UTC format. The format string is split at the first whitespace into a date part and an optional time part. Date part tokens (case-insensitive, each exactly once): `yyyy`, `mm` (month), `dd`; any other characters are kept literally. Time part tokens: `hh` and `mm` (minutes) — `mm` means month in the date part and minutes in the time part. If a stored value includes a time it is always shown: through the format's time part when present, otherwise appended as ` hh:mm`. Date-only values never invent a time. Invalid formats fall back to the canonical display. Agent-facing output (`--plain` CLI output and MCP responses) always stays canonical regardless of this setting. Example: `dateFormat: dd/mm/yyyy` renders `2026-07-04 21:54` as `04/07/2026 21:54`.

> **Custom Backlog Folder**: `backlog_directory` is chosen when the project is initialized — select "Custom project-relative path" in the wizard or run `backlog init --backlog-dir my-backlog --config-location root` — and init refuses to move the folder afterwards. Unlike every other key here it is read only from `backlog.config.yml` in the project root: the same key inside `backlog/config.yml` is ignored, and `backlog config` cannot set, get, or list it. The path is only checked lexically: absolute values and paths that normalize to outside the project are ignored, while a relative path that symlinks outside the repository is accepted. When the value is ignored Backlog.md uses `backlog/` or `.backlog/` if one exists, and otherwise reports that no project was found.
