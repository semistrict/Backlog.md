## Task Creation Guide

Use this guide when `backlog instructions` or the user indicates that new Backlog tasks are needed.

### Step 1: Search First

Always check whether the work is already tracked.

Recommended CLI commands:

- `backlog search "desktop app" --plain`
- `backlog task list --status "<todo status>" --plain`
- `backlog task list --status "<active status>" --plain`
- `backlog task list --exclude-status "<terminal status>" --plain`
- `backlog task list --type {{TASK_TYPE:1}} --plain`
- `backlog task list --search "desktop app" --labels frontend,bug --limit 20 --plain`

Avoid broad unfiltered listing when the project may have many tasks. Use `--status`, `--exclude-status`, `--type`, `--project`, `--assignee`, `--unassigned`, `--parent`, `--priority`, `--labels`, `--search`, or `--limit` where applicable. Check the size with `--count`, and read a long list in windows with `--max-count` and `--skip`; cut output ends with the command for the next window. Repeat `--exclude-status` or pass comma-separated configured statuses to exclude multiple states. Repeat `--type` or pass comma-separated configured task types to include multiple types. Repeat `--project` or pass comma-separated configured projects to include multiple projects.

Use `backlog task view {{TASK_ID:123}} --plain` to read full context for likely matches.

### Step 2: Assess Scope Before Creating Tasks

Decide whether the request is:

- A single atomic task that can be completed in one focused PR.
- A multi-task feature or initiative that needs subtasks or dependencies.

Ask:

1. Can this be completed in a single focused pull request?
2. Would a reviewer be comfortable reviewing all changes at once?
3. Are there natural independent delivery points?
4. Does the work span multiple subsystems, layers, or ownership areas?
5. Are multiple tasks likely to touch the same component?

### Step 3: Choose Task Structure

Use subtasks when the work shares one goal and one subsystem:

```bash
backlog task create "Desktop application"
backlog task create -p {{TASK_ID:10}} "Set up shell"
backlog task create -p {{TASK_ID:10}} "Wire IPC"
```

Use `--parent`/`-p` only with an existing task ID returned by `backlog task create`, `backlog task list`, or `backlog task view`. Do not pass milestone IDs such as `m-0` to `--parent`; assign a task to a milestone with `--milestone`/`-m`.

Use separate tasks with dependencies when work spans independent components:

```bash
backlog task create "Add bulk update API"
backlog task create "Add bulk update UI" --dep {{TASK_ID:21}}
```

### Step 4: Create Tasks

Write tasks so a future agent can act on them without prior conversation context.

Include:

- A clear title.
- A description that captures why the task exists: the problem, trigger, or user need behind it, plus any context a future agent cannot recover from the code. The acceptance criteria already state what will be true when the work is done — do not restate them here.
- Acceptance criteria that are specific, testable, and independent.
- References or documentation when they are needed for implementation.
- Dependencies when work must happen in order.
- An assignee with `-a` when the task has a known owner; omitting it applies the project's configured `defaultAssignee` when one is set, and `-a ""` leaves the task unassigned instead.
- In projects whose `prioritization` is `rice` (check with `backlog config get prioritization`), RICE inputs you can estimate: `--reach`, `--impact` (3, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25), `--confidence` (100, 80, 50) and `--effort`. These projects do not use `--priority`.

For future work, do **not** add an implementation plan or speculative code approach during task creation. Creation
captures the durable intent, context, scope, acceptance criteria, references, and dependencies. The worker researches
the current system and records the plan after picking up and activating the task, because the codebase or constraints may
change before then. The narrow exception is already-started work being created directly in a configured active status
(for example, In Progress); its current researched plan may be supplied at creation.

Examples:

```bash
backlog task create "Add project search" \
  -d "Finding anything means running three separate commands, and matches in the ones you skip are missed silently. One search command covers tasks, docs, and decisions." \
  --ac "Search returns matching tasks by title and description" \
  --ac "Search supports --plain output" \
  --ac "Tests cover task, document, and decision results"
```

Too thin: `-d "Users can search tasks, docs, and decisions from one CLI command."` states the change but not the need,
so a future agent cannot weigh scope or alternatives.

```bash
backlog task create "Add settings docs" \
  --doc docs/settings.md \
  --ref https://example.com/spec
```

### Shell Quoting for Literal Backticks

When task text includes Markdown code spans, quote it so the shell passes the backticks literally. Unescaped backticks in double-quoted or unquoted arguments are command substitution in many shells, and Backlog.md cannot recover the original text after the shell has already executed it.

Use single-quoted CLI arguments for values that contain literal backticks:

```bash
backlog task create 'Document `backlog init` setup' \
  --ac 'Instructions mention `backlog init --defaults` literally'
```

If single quotes are not practical in your shell, escape each literal backtick before running the command. Do not rely on Backlog.md to sanitize accidental command output after substitution.

### Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria define the expected behavior, not implementation steps.

Good criteria:

- Are testable.
- Include edge cases when relevant.
- Include documentation and test expectations when required.

Avoid criteria like "Implement helper function" unless the helper itself is the user-visible deliverable.

### Definition of Done

Project-level Definition of Done defaults apply automatically. Add task-specific DoD items only when this task needs extra completion hygiene:

```bash
backlog task create "Ship audit export" --dod "Manual export checked with sample data"
```

### After Creation

Report the created task IDs, titles, and key acceptance criteria to the user. If the user asks for changes, update tasks through `backlog task edit`.

If you will continue from task creation into implementation in the same session, stop and read `backlog instructions task-execution` before viewing, assigning, planning, editing, or implementing a task. Task creation is complete once the work is tracked; execution uses a separate workflow.
